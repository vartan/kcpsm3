This is assembler for Xilinx processor KCPSM3. All C source codes are provided under GNU GPL license.
In the doc/ directory you can find a documentation. If you make any changes to the program, you can add
your stuff there.

Currently provided tests in directory test/ were downloaded from the internet (bleyer.org/pacoblaze; xilinx).
There are some my own tests.

This version has been modified to generate verilog instead of a HEX file. Type `./kcpsm3 -i INPUT_FILE.psm -o program.v` to generate a verilog module with the name program.
